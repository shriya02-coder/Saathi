## Problem Statement
An Anganwadi is a type of rural child care centre in India. These Aanganwadi workers (AWW) counsel mothers. They often work long hours and face issues while providing counselling to mothers. Our goal here is:
  - To help AWW to provide timely, contextual inputs to mothers during their visits
  - Build an innovative solution that would work like a decision tree for AWW and improve the overall counselling
  - Provide an ability to monitor the counselling process by FMCH
  
## About
* We propose a solution which consists of a decision tree model that aids the AWW worker to provide right counselling based on certain pre-defined parameters and conditions.
* The model minimises data entry by providing a user-friendly interface that allows AWW workers to get the correct set of guidelines by choosing the suitable parameters. 
* The solution also aims to increase engagement among the AWW workers by providing them a facility to share their experience and ask relevant questions to aim them in their counselling.
* This solution minimises time consumption by providing immediate results alongside having an extensive learning page consisting of videos, exercises and dietary instructions. 

## Features
The following are the features of our website:
  * Decision Tree: An interactive decision tree that helps to make decisions based on the chosen parameters.
Database connectivity is provided to this model. 
  * Secured query section: Password protected query section for management of counselling related queries 
  * Blog share page: Page to share learnings and experiences so that it can benefit other AWW workers and help them provide better assistance to the beneficiaries 
  * Learning: An entire section dedicated to various health practises.
